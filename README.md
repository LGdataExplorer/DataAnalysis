# DataAnalysis
 A comprehensive repository showcasing my data analysis and visualization skills. I've worked with various relational and non-relational databases, and created interactive dashboards using tools such as Tableau, Power BI, and Python. I've also gained proficiency in data manipulation and analysis using Python libraries like NumPy and pandas, as well as R.
