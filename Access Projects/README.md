Project Title:Creating a Database Project for a Fictional Cookie Business

Understanding the Task:
Create a database in MS Access using three Excel files: Customers, Orders, and Products.

Setting Up the Database:

Designing the Database Tables
Customers Table:

Fields: FirstName, LastName, Email, Address, Phone, City, State, Zip, Country, Notes
Data Types: Text (for most fields), Number (for Zip)
Orders Table:

Fields: CustomerID, ProductID, OrderDate, CookiesOrdered, PricePerCookie, Revenue, OrderFilled
Data Types: Number (for CustomerID, ProductID, CookiesOrdered, PricePerCookie, Revenue), Date/Time (for OrderDate), Yes/No (for OrderFilled)
Products Table:

Fields: CookieID, CookieName, Price
Data Types: Number (for CookieID), Text (for CookieName), Number (for Price)

Establishing Relationships
Customers to Orders: Create a one-to-many relationship between Customers and Orders. The primary key in Customers (e.g., a unique customer ID) should be the foreign key in Orders.
Products to Orders: Create a one-to-many relationship between Products and Orders. The primary key in Products (e.g., a unique cookie ID) should be the foreign key in Orders.
