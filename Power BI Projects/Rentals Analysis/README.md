Project:CineMax Rentals Data Analysis Project: Uncovering Insights with Power BI

Description:This project utilizes provided CineMax Rentals data to create a realistic business scenario. We'll extract and analyze data(in several tables relevant to rentals, customers, films, and operations) using MySQL and Power BI, answering specific business questions through descriptive, diagnostic, and predictive analysis.

Customer Demographics: What is the distribution of customers by city and country? Create a report showing the number of customers in each location.
Film Inventory: What is the current inventory status? Provide a breakdown of films available in each store.

Diagnostic Analysis:
Rental Trends: Analyze rental patterns over the last year. Identify months with highest and lowest activity and explore potential reasons.
Payment Analysis: Investigate payment records to determine which customer groups (e.g., by city, country, or store) contribute the most to revenue.

Predictive Analysis:
Revenue Forecast: Based on rental and payment data from the past two years, forecast revenue for the next quarter. Project potential trends and anticipate changes.
